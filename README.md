## Business Description
H&M Group is a family of brands and businesses with 53 online markets and approximately 4,850 stores. Our online store offers shoppers an extensive selection of products to browse through. But with too many choices, customers might not quickly find what interests them or what they are looking for, and ultimately, they might not make a purchase. To enhance the shopping experience, product recommendations are key. More importantly, helping customers make the right choices also has a positive implication for sustainability, as it reduces returns, and thereby minimizes emissions from transportation.

## Overview 
The main aim of this project is to build a recommendation system for the user to enhance their shopping performance. In this project we have used Content Based Filtering and K-Nearest Neighbours Machine Learning algorithm. For the user to access this recommendation the UI interface created using Streamlit. 

Note: Before building of this app the EDA and Feature Engineering process were involved and those notebooks are attached. The dataset used in this project was part of Kaggle competition (get the data from the kaggel) and also screenshot of UI image is also attached.
